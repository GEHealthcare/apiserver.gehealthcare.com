Welcome to the Centricity FHIR API Developer Support Wiki
This collaboration community is for Centricityâ„¢ Practice Solution and Centricity EMR FHIR API Developer Support. It is intended to be a peer-to-peer support forum where developers can post questions and get help from other Centricity FHIR developers. GE Healthcare Digital Customer Support does monitor this and will assist where appropriate.
